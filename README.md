**Kanji Aid** is a spaced repititon flashcard memorization app for learning Japanese kanji. Learn to read kanji by writing mnemonics of their basic parts. Mnemonics combined with daily review repititions envoke long-term memory, making it so just by glancing at a kanji, you can remember how to write it and it's meaning in English.

Based on the book **Remember the Kanji Vol 1** by James Heisig


## How to use it

- Learn a few new kanji everyday by writing a mnemonic for it. The more creative and thought provoking of a story you write, the more likely you are to remember the kanji when you see it again.
- Burn it into your brain using the [SM2 spaced repitition algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo#Description_of_SM-2_algorithm). Review the kanji you are the most likely to forget everyday until you master them.

### More Info

This method of learning Japanese is bizarre to some people. However, this is the method that worked for me so I decided to make an app out of it. Currently the app is not released on the app store.

[Super long video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgRte6oSoF8&ab_channel=MattvsJapan) explaing why I think this is the best method for learning Japanese.
More info about the [author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Heisig). Really incredible guy.

I also used a lot of resources from [Kanji Alive](https://github.com/kanjialive) and [RTK Search](https://github.com/hochanh/rtk-search)
