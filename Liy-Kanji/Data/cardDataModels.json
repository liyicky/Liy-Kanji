After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man."

And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers.

Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing."
